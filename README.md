- QR Code Integration : Generate and scan QR codes for quick document tracking and status updates
- Document Workflow Management : Track documents as they move through different offices and handlers
- Notification System : Real-time notifications for document transfers, receipts, and status changes
- Idle Document Monitoring : Automated system to identify and report documents that haven't been processed within a specified timeframe
- User Management : Add, edit, and archive user accounts with different role assignments
- Conversation System : In-app messaging related to specific documents
- Reporting : Generate reports on document status and workflow metrics
